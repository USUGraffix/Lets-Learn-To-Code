// Programing is just writing instructions for your computer to complete

//Each instruction you write when you program is called a statement

//Statements always end in a semicolon
let peterGatsby;

//The statement DECLARES a variable
//Variables are containers that store values/data types
//peterGatsby is a variable created using the key word let.

//The key word let tells the computer "I want to make a variable who's value can change"
//Right now the peterGatsby variable has no value

//but we can use operators and data types to give it a value

peterGatsby = 'A punk sucks';

// the line above uses the "=" operator to assign peterGatsby equal to a string containing "A punk b#$^#@"

//"=" is a operator used to assign values or data types
// when you use a single "=" your are assigning a variable on the left to a value or data type on the right

//Here DandyReyes is assigned to  the string "A birdman"
let dandyReyes = 'A birdman';

//There are many keywords other than let,many operators other than "=" ,and many data types other than strings for example

const margsHouseCaughtFire = 9 + 10;

//const is a keyword that tells the computer "I want to make a variable who's value cannot change"

//to the right of the "=" we see 9+10
//here we are adding two number data types by using the "+" operator
//A single + between two numbers adds the numbers as you would think
//You can also + two different data types but the result may not always be what you think
//The other math symbols also function as operators when coding "-","/", and "*"

//you can also use variables in place of "raw" data types
let alisonsBirdCount = 3;
let dandysBirdCount = 9001;
let totalAmountOfBirds = alisonsBirdCount + dandysBirdCount;

//We assigned totalAmountOfBirds to the sum of alisonsBirdCount + dandysBirdCount;

//if we wanted to have this value logged to our terminal we would use something called a function 
//console.log() in javascript prints out what ever you pass to its parenthesis  your terminal

//pass alisonsBirdCount  to console.log()
//pass totalAmountOfBirds to console.log()
//pass a string explaining the amount + the variable holding the amount to console.log()
