### Challenge 2

Dang, you really want it!! Let's go! This is challenge 2 with HTML and CSS

You have 2 awesome sites that will walk you through css grid and flexbox.

1. [Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
2. [CSS Grid](https://cssgridgarden.com/)

Here are resources for [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [css grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) that you can use if you are stuck.

Here is the main challenge, you built an awesome form so people can contact you on challenge 1. Let's spruce that up. I want you all to encase your form in a div, center that on your page using either flexbox and css grid.
Then, style the inside of your form as you like!

> Note: No other layout css like float, margin: auto 0, text-align: center is allowed!
